# netweir

A web scraping library for Python, with the heavy lifting done in Rust.

This is early. What works today is fetching and parsing: ask for a page,
get it back the way Chrome would have, and pull out what you want with CSS.

```python
import netweir

page = netweir.get("https://books.toscrape.com/")

page.css("h1::text").get()  # "All products"
page.css(".price_color::text").getall()  # ["£51.77", "£53.74", ...]
page.css("article h3 a::attr(href)").getall()  # ["/catalogue/...", ...]

for book in page.css("article.product_pod"):
    print(book.css("h3 a::attr(title)").get(), book.css(".price_color::text").get())
```

If you've used Scrapy, `::text`, `::attr()`, `get()` and `getall()` mean what
you think they mean. Already have the HTML? `netweir.parse(html)` skips the
request and gives you something you query the same way.

## Looking like a browser

Most sites don't block scrapers by reading their code. They block them by
the first few hundred bytes of the connection: which TLS ciphers and
extensions arrive, what the HTTP/2 settings frame says, which headers come
first. A Python HTTP library gives itself away before it has
asked for anything.

netweir sends what Chrome 154 sends. Not something close to it: the same
ClientHello, the same HTTP/2 settings and priorities, the same headers in
the same order and the same capitalisation over HTTP/1.1. Cookies go where
Chrome puts them, and redirects are followed hop by hop the way Chrome
follows them, header order after a redirect included.

You don't have to take that on trust. Chrome was recorded doing four
navigations against a local server: a page that sets a cookie, a revisit,
a redirect to another site and one within the site. `cargo test -p
netweir-core` has netweir do the same four and fails if any request differs
from Chrome's. The public checker at tls.peet.ws reports the same JA4
fingerprint for both: `t13d1517h2_8daaf6152771_cb7bf5808d99`.

One known difference: Chrome sends a `priority` header only over HTTP/2,
and netweir can't tell a server lacks HTTP/2 until it has answered once. So
the first request to an https server that only speaks HTTP/1.1 carries that
header; every request after it doesn't.

For many pages at once, use a client. It keeps connections and cookies
between requests, and the requests run concurrently in Rust:

```python
async with netweir.Client(proxy="http://user:pass@proxy:8080") as client:
    pages = await client.get_many(urls)
```

A request that fails before any response arrives raises `netweir.FetchError`,
and its `kind` says why: `"timeout"`, `"connect"`, `"tls"` and so on. A 404 is
still a page; check `page.status`.

## Why it's fast

Pages are parsed by [lexbor](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor), the same
spec-compliant C parser selectolax uses. The difference is what happens
after: netweir runs the whole query in Rust and hands Python a finished list
of strings, instead of a Python object for every element along the way. The
GIL is released while it works, so threads parse in parallel.

`bench/parse.py` pulls every price, title and link out of a generated shop
page:

| | 1 MB page | 10 MB page |
|---|---|---|
| netweir | 5.0 ms | 61 ms |
| selectolax | 5.3 ms | 64 ms |
| BeautifulSoup (lxml) | 196 ms | 2.3 s |
| lxml + cssselect | 347 ms | 82 s |
| parsel | 353 ms | 82 s |

Measured on an Apple M-series laptop with Python 3.14. The lead over selectolax is small because both use lexbor; it comes from doing the extraction in Rust. Run it yourself:
`uv run --group bench python bench/parse.py`.

Pages you don't control can be built to be slow to parse. Pass a timeout and
netweir gives up instead of hanging:

```python
netweir.parse(html, timeout=2.0)  # raises netweir.ParseTimeout
```

The timeout bounds time, not memory. A small page built to abuse the HTML5
spec's rules for misnested formatting tags can still make any spec-compliant
parser allocate gigabytes; a cap on that comes with the crawler.

## Building

You need Rust, a C compiler, CMake and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jamesconwaydev/netweir
cd netweir
uv sync --group dev
uv run maturin develop --uv
uv run pytest
```

## Licence

AGPL-3.0. If that doesn't work for your company, a commercial licence is
available. See NOTICE for the licences of what netweir bundles.

Please use it the way you'd want your own site scraped. netweir obeys
robots.txt once crawling lands; until then, that's on you.
