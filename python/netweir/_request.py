    """A page to fetch in a crawl, and what to do with it.

    ``callback`` is a function, or the name of a spider method, called with
    the Page; it defaults to the spider's ``parse``. ``errback`` is called
    with the Request and the FetchError when no response arrives. ``meta``
    travels with the request and comes back as ``page.meta``. ``depth`` is
    set by the crawl: 0 for a start request, one more than its page's for
    a request a callback yields. ``browser=True`` fetches it in Chrome,
    and the callback's ``page.browser`` is the page, open until the
    callback returns.

    ``method`` and one of ``form``, ``json`` or ``body`` send something
    other than a GET: ``form`` as a form submission (URL-encoded), ``json``
    or a raw ``body`` as a page's script would send it. ``referer`` is the
    page it comes from; ``page.follow`` sets it. A POST or PATCH that gets
    a server error isn't retried, since the server may have acted on it,
    unless ``retry_post=True``; nor is it ever handed to Chrome.
